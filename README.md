# WP theme howto
Here are the the sources for [my post series](http://oriolo.ru/series/create-wp-theme-from-html/) on creating theme for WordPress. 

You can switch tags and see the changes.

In the folder `sources` you can find HTML and CSS, and the theme in the folder `theme` :)

The series is originally written in Russian and posted in my blog.
